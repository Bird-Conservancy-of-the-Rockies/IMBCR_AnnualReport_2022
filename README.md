# IMBCR_AnnualReport_2022
Code to produce the IMBCR Annual Report as a Quarto Book in html and pdf formats.


## About Quarto Books

## Current items updated by hand (not programmatically)

## A note about table captions

Current RMarkdown and Quarto do not support cross references for interactive HTML tables (e.g. DT:::datatable). They can be cross referenced as figures but this doesn't make sense. For 2022, I am putting the table captions in manually. See [Github issue #628](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/628)
