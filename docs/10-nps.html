<p>We obtained results for Greater Yellowstone Network: Total by compiling and jointly analyzing data from three strata.</p>
<p>Field technicians completed 8 of 7 planned surveys (114%) in 2022. Technicians conducted 101 point counts within the 7 surveyed grid cells between June 2 and July 18. They detected 74 bird species, including 0 priority species.</p>
<p>Bird Conservancy estimated densities and population sizes for 127 species that were detected in any year during which surveys were conducted, 0 of which are priority species. The data yielded robust density estimates (CV &lt; 50%) for 36 species.</p>
<p>Bird Conservancy estimated the proportion of 1 km² grid cells occupied (Ψ, Psi) throughout Greater Yellowstone Network: Total for 125 species that were detected in any year during which surveys were conducted, 0 of which are priority species. The data yielded robust occupancy estimates (CV &lt; 50%) for 37 species.</p>
