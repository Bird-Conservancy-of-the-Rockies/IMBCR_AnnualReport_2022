    "text": "2022 Field Season Report\nBird Conservancy of the Rockies (Bird Conservancy), in conjunction with its partners, conducted the 15th consecutive year of landbird monitoring for the Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions (IMBCR) program.\nIMBCR is based on a spatially balanced sampling design which provides inference to avian populations at various scales, from local management units to entire states or Bird Conservation Regions, facilitating conservation at local and national levels. The nested design also provides a consistent and flexible framework for understanding and comparing the status and annual changes of bird populations with local and regional context.\nCollaboration across organizations and spatial scales increases sample sizes and improves the accuracy and precision of population estimates. Analyzing the data collectively allows us to estimate detection probabilities for species that would otherwise have insufficient numbers of detections at local scales.\nFor these reasons, the IMBCR program is well-positioned to address conservation and management needs for a wide range of stakeholders, encouraging an interdisciplinary approach to bird conservation that combines monitoring, research, and management.  \nBird Conservancy of the Rockies\n14500 Lark Bunting Lane\nBrighton, CO 80603\n303-659-4348\nwww.birdconservancy.org"

    "text": "Monitoring is an essential component of wildlife management and conservation science (Marsh & Trenham, 2008; Witmer, 2005). Common goals of population monitoring are to estimate the population status of target species and to detect changes in populations over time (Sauer & Knutson, 2008; Thompson, White, & Gowan, 1998). In addition to providing basic information on species distributions, effective monitoring programs can identify species that are at-risk because of small or declining populations (Dreitz, Lukacs, & Knopf, 2006); provide an understanding of how management actions affect populations (Alexander, Stephens, Geupel, & Will, 2008; Lyons, Runge, Laskowski, & Kendall, 2008); and evaluate population responses to landscape alteration and climate change (Baron et al., 2008; Lindenmayer & Likens, 2009).\nWhile monitoring at local scales remains critical, there is an increasing need to monitor the consequences of environmental change over large spatial and temporal scales and address questions much larger than those that can be answered within individual management units (Dreitz, Stinson, Hahn, Tack, & Lukacs, 2017; Lindenmayer & Likens, 2009). Reconciling disparities between the geographic scale of management actions and the scale of ecological and species-specific responses is a persistent challenge for natural resource management agencies (Ruggiero, Hayward, & Squires, 1994). Population monitoring of eco-regional landscapes provides an important context for evaluating population change at local and regional scales, with the potential to identify causal factors and management actions for species recovery (Manley, Schlesinger, Roth, & Van Horne, 2005; Sauer & Knutson, 2008).\nBefore monitoring can be used by land managers to guide conservation efforts, sound program designs and analytical methods are necessary to produce unbiased population estimates (Sauer & Knutson, 2008). At the most fundamental level, reliable knowledge about the status of avian populations requires accounting for spatial variation and incomplete detection of the target species (Pollock et al., 2002; Rosenstock, Anderson, Giesen, Leukering, & Carter, 2002; Thompson, 2002). Addressing spatial variation entails the use of probabilistic sampling designs, which allows population estimates to be extended over the entire area of interest (Thompson et al., 1998). Accounting for incomplete detection involves the use of appropriate sampling and analytical methods to address the fact that few, if any, species are so conspicuous that they are detected with certainty when present during a survey. Accounting for these two sources of variation ensures that observed trends reflect true population changes rather than artifacts of the sampling and observation processes (Pollock et al., 2002; Thompson, 2002).\nThe apparent large-scale declines of avian populations and the loss, fragmentation and degradation of native habitats highlight the need for extensive and rigorous landbird monitoring programs (Rich et al., 2004; US North American Bird Conservation Initiative Monitoring Subcommittee, 2007). The US North American Bird Conservation Initiative’s (NABCI) “Opportunities for Improving Avian Monitoring” (NABCI Monitoring Subcommittee, 2007) provided goals for avian monitoring programs including:\n\nGoal 1: Fully integrate monitoring into bird management and conservation practices and ensure that monitoring is aligned with management and conservation priorities.\nGoal 2: Coordinate monitoring programs among organizations and integrate them across spatial scales to solve conservation or management problems effectively.\nGoal 3: Increase the value of monitoring information by improving statistical design.\nGoal 4: Maintain bird population monitoring data in modern data management systems. Recognize legal, institutional, proprietary, and other constraints while still providing greater availability of raw data, associated metadata, and summary data for bird monitoring programs.\n\nWith the NABCI Monitoring Subcommittee (2007) guidelines in mind, Bird Conservancy of the Rockies and partners initiated a broad-scale collaborative bird monitoring program in 2008 entitled “Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions” (IMBCR) (Blakesley & Hanni, 2009). See Appendix B: IMBCR Program and Stratification History for a complete history of this program. The monitoring objectives of the IMBCR partnership are to:\n\nProvide robust density, population and occupancy estimates that account for incomplete detection and are comparable at different geographic extents;\nProvide long-term status and trend data for all regularly occurring breeding landbird species throughout the study area;\nProvide a design framework to spatially integrate existing bird monitoring efforts in the region to provide better information on distribution and abundance of breeding landbirds, especially for high priority species;\nProvide basic habitat association data for most bird species to address habitat management issues;\nMaintain a high-quality database that effectively merges records between regional data nodes and is accessible to all of our collaborators as well as to the public over the internet, in the form of raw and summarized data; and\nGenerate decision support tools that help guide conservation efforts and provide a better measure of conservation success.\n\nThe IMBCR design includes Bird Conservation Regions (BCRs) as sampling frames (Figure 5.1), stratified by land ownership inside each BCR (NABCI Monitoring Subcommittee, 2007). BCRs provide a spatially consistent framework for bird conservation in North America. Each BCR represents a distinct ecological region with similar bird communities, vegetation types, and resource management interests (NABCI, 2000). Population monitoring within BCRs is implemented with a flexible hierarchical framework of nested units, where information on bird populations can be partitioned into smaller units for small-scale conservation planning, or aggregated to support large-scale conservation efforts. By focusing on scales relevant to management and conservation, information obtained from monitoring in BCRs can be integrated into research and management objectives at various scales applicable to managers (Pavlacky et al., 2017; Ruth et al., 2003).\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Bird Conservation Regions throughout North America, excluding Hawaii and Mexico"

    "section": "6.2 Sampling Design",
    "text": "6.2 Sampling Design\n\nSampling Frame and Stratification\nA key component of the IMBCR design is the ability to infer about bird populations across spatial scales, from small management units, such as individual national forests or field offices, to entire states and BCRs. This is accomplished through hierarchical (nested) stratification, which allows data from smaller-order strata to be combined to make inferences about higher-order strata. For example, data from each individual national forest stratum in USFS Region 2 are combined to produce Region-wide population estimates; data from each individual stratum in Montana are combined to produce statewide estimates; and data from each individual stratum in BCR 17 are combined to produce BCR-wide estimates.\nWe define strata based on areas to which IMBCR partners wanted to make inferences. We defined the largest sampling frame as the intersection of state and BCR boundaries (e.g., Wyoming-BCR 10). We base the strata within the state-BCR sampling frames on fixed attributes, such as land ownership boundaries, elevation zones, major river systems and wilderness/roadless designations.\n\n\nSampling Units\nWe define sampling units as 1 km² cells, each containing 16 evenly spaced sample points, 250 meters apart (Figure 3). We define potential sampling units by superimposing a uniform grid of cells over each state in the study area. We then assign each cell to a stratum using ArcGIS version 10.X and higher (Environmental Systems Research Institute, 2017). For all stratifications developed after 2012, we use the United States National Grid (USNG), a nonproprietary alphanumeric referencing system derived from the Military Grid Reference System that was created by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Example 1 km² sampling unit in the IMBCR design.\n\n\n\n\nSample Selection\nWithin each stratum, we use generalized random-tessellation stratification (GRTS), a spatially balanced sampling algorithm, to select sampling units (Stevens Jr. & Olsen, 2004). The GRTS design has useful properties with respect to long-term monitoring of birds at large spatial scales including:\n\nSpatially balanced sampling is generally more efficient than simple random sampling of natural resources (Stevens Jr. & Olsen, 2004). Incorporating information about spatial autocorrelation in the data can increase precision in density estimates.\nAll sampling units in the sampling frame are ordered, such that any set of consecutively numbered units is a spatially well-balanced sample (Stevens Jr. & Olsen, 2004). In the case of fluctuating budgets, IMBCR partners can adjust the sampling effort among years within each stratum while still preserving a random, spatially balanced sampling design.\n\nA minimum of two sampling units within each stratum are required to estimate the variances of population parameters. However, reliable stratum-level occupancy estimates require larger sample sizes, with a minimum of approximately 8-10 samples per stratum. Additional samples may be required for strata comprising large geographic areas. Because we estimate regional density and occupancy using an area weighted mean, adding more samples to a particular stratum does not bias the overall estimate, it simply increases the precision. After the initial two sampling units were selected, the remaining allocation of sampling effort among strata was based on the priorities of the funding partners."

    "text": "6.3 Sampling Methods\nIMBCR observers with excellent aural and visual bird-identification skills conducted field work in 2020. Prior to conducting surveys, observers completed an intensive training program that was largely virtual to ensure full understanding of the field protocol and review bird and plant identification. Observers were also shadowed by a crew leader at the start of the field season to ensure they understood the protocol and could identify all birds within a region.\nObservers conducted point counts (Buckland et al., 2001) following protocols established by IMBCR partners (Hanni, White, Birek, Van Lanen, & McLaren, 2012). Observers conducted surveys in the morning, beginning one-half hour before sunrise and concluding no later than five hours after sunrise. Observers recorded the start time for every point count conducted. For every bird detected during the six-minute period, observers recorded species, sex, horizontal distance from the observer, minute, type of detection (e.g., call, song, visual), whether the bird was thought to be a migrant, and whether the observer was able to visually identify each record.\nObservers measured distances to each bird using laser rangefinders when possible. When it was not possible, observers estimated the distance by measuring to some object near the bird using a laser rangefinder. In addition to recording all bird species detected in the area during point counts, observers recorded birds flying over but not using the immediate surrounding landscape. Observers also recorded Abert’s squirrel (Sciurus aberti), American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), and American pika (Ochotona princeps). While observers traveled between points within a sampling unit, they recorded the presence of any species not recorded during a point count. The opportunistic detections of these species are used for distribution purposes only.\nObservers considered all non-independent detections of birds (i.e., flocks or pairs of conspecific birds together in close proximity) as part of a “cluster” rather than as independent observations. Observers recorded the number of birds detected within each cluster along with a letter code to distinguish between multiple clusters.\nAt the start and end of each survey, observers recorded time, ambient temperature, cloud cover, precipitation, and wind speed. Observers navigated to each point using hand-held Global Positioning System units. Before beginning each six-minute count, surveyors recorded vegetation data within a 50m radius of the point via ocular estimation. Vegetation data included the dominant habitat type and relative abundance, percent cover and mean height of trees and shrubs by species, grass height, and ground cover. Observers recorded vegetation data quietly to allow birds time to return to their normal habits prior to beginning each count.\nFor more detailed information about survey methods and vegetation data collection protocols, refer to Bird Conservancy’s Field Protocol for Spatially Balanced Sampling of Landbird Populations on our Avian Data Center. You will also find links to past and current protocols and data sheets."

    "section": "6.4 Data Analysis",
    "text": "6.4 Data Analysis\n\nDistance Analysis Assumptions\nDistance sampling theory was developed to account for the decreasing probability of detecting an object of interest (e.g., a bird) with increasing distance from the observer to the object (Buckland et al., 2001). The detection probability is used to adjust the count of birds to account for birds that were present but undetected. Application of distance theory requires that five critical assumptions be met: 1) all birds at and near the sampling location (distance = 0) are detected; 2) distances to birds are measured accurately; 3) birds do not move in response to the observer’s presence (Buckland et al., 2001; Thomas et al., 2010); 4) cluster sizes are recorded without error; and 5) the sampling units are representative of the entire survey region (Buckland, Marsden, & Green, 2008).\n\n\nDensity Estimation\nWe developed a Bayesian, zero-inflated N-mixture model (Royle 2004, Sillett et al. 2011) to estimate density and abundance for all strata and superstrata across all species with sufficient data. We used distance sampling to estimate detection probabilities and adjust counts accordingly. For a detailed description of statistical analyses performed, see (Appendix D).\nBayesian approaches to density estimation provide several benefits over traditional distance sampling analyses, while providing similar and unbiased estimates of density and abundance. First, with the nested design of IMBCR, point count locations within a 1-km2 grid cell are not independent. Therefore, with traditional methods, it is necessary to treat each point as a spatial replicate within the grid cell(i.e., average counts across points). However, it is unlikely that bird densities are uniform within a grid cell, and a better solution would be to estimate density at the point count location. Bayesian models provide the flexibility to do this, while correctly accounting for the lack of independence among points. The second benefit, also provided by this flexibility, is the ability to include covariates to explain changes in density. This allows us to explicitly estimate the response of bird density to variables, such as habitat variables, management actions, or time (i.e., trend). Finally, Bayesian approaches allow for sharing of information across parameters. This can assist in obtaining estimates at sites with little data or provide measures of uncertainty when no birds were detected, such as at low densities and/or small sample sizes.\nWe fit a series of models to the data from each species that had the same model structure describing density estimation but varied in detection structure (see Observation process section below). We used zero-inflation to account for excess zeros in the data, where abundance at a point count location (N) is conditional on the point’s true occupancy state (z) of a species at the point count location, and the mean abundance within a 1-km2 grid cell was modeled as a function of year to estimate stratum-specific trends.\nAll points within a grid cell shared a mean abundance to account for the lack of independence of those points, but abundance was allowed to vary spatially within a grid cell (i.e., by point) through Poisson variation. To avoid predicting species occurrence outside of observed ranges, we fixed occupancy probabilities to 0 for all strata in which the species was never observed and used a prior informed by the observed proportion of grid-year combinations in a stratum in which the species was detected.\nWe derived density at the point count location by dividing the estimated abundance by the area of the point count circle (see Observation process section below) and multiplying by cluster size. We derived stratum-level density estimates by averaging all point-level density estimates within each stratum, and we took the area-weighted average of strata estimates to obtain superstratum estimates.\nObservation process\nWe estimated the probability of detecting an independent cluster of individuals by fitting distance functions to the distance data collected during surveys (Buckland et al. 2001). We fit four detection models including:\n1. half-normal constant (HN(.))\n2. hazard rate constant (Haz(.))\n3. half-normal year (HN(t))\n4. hazard rate year (Haz(t))\nWe removed the furthest 10% of observed detection distances from the data set and binned the remaining detections into 10 evenly spaced distance classes. The furthest remaining detection distance became the radius of the point count circle with which we estimated density.\nDetection model selection\nTo minimize computing time but find the most parsimonious detection function, we fit detection-only models to the distance data, using the four model structures described above. We used the Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC; Watanabe 2010, Hooten and Hobbs 2015) to select the most parsimonious detection structure and then used that structure for detection probabilities in the full model to estimate density and abundance.\nTrend Estimates\nWe estimated trends for individual strata by calculating the least-squares regression mean and standard errors for the intercept and slope of the log densities across the monitoring period. We calculated these parameters for every Bayesian iteration to account for uncertainty around density estimates.\nWe developed a post-hoc approach to estimate trends for superstrata. Using the rolled-up estimates of density for a superstratum, we fit a general linear model (GLM) to the samples from each Bayesian iteration. Fitting a GLM across iterations allowed us to incorporate uncertainty in superstratum trends due to uncertainty around density estimates, but it did not account for temporal variation. To incorporate this second form of variation, we sampled a random intercept and slope for each iteration using the mean and standard error estimated using the GLM and made inference on the distribution of the resampled values.\n\n\nOccupancy Analysis\nOccupancy estimation is most commonly used to quantify the proportion of sample units (i.e., 1 km² cells) occupied by an organism (MacKenzie et al., 2002). The application of occupancy modeling requires multiple surveys of the sample unit in space or time to estimate a detection probability (MacKenzie et al., 2006). The detection probability adjusts the proportion of sites occupied to account for species that were present but undetected (MacKenzie et al., 2002). We used a removal design (MacKenzie et al., 2006), to estimate a detection probability for each species, in which we binned minutes one and two, minutes three and four and minutes five and six to meet the assumption of a monotonic decline in the detection rates through time. After the target species was detected at a point, we set all subsequent sampling intervals at that point to “missing data” (MacKenzie et al., 2006).\nThe 16 points in each sampling unit served as spatial replicates for estimating the proportion of points occupied within the sampled sampling units. We used a Bayesian, multi-scale occupancy model (Nichols et al. 2008, Mordecai et al. 2011, Green et al. 2019) to estimate 1) the probability of detecting a species given presence (p), 2) the proportion of points occupied by a species given presence within sampled sampling units (θ, Theta) and 3) the proportion of sampling units occupied by a species (ψ, Psi).\nWe truncated the data, using only detections <125 m from the sample points, except for Accipitriformes, Anseriformes, Falconiformes, Galliformes, Gruiformes, Pelecaniformes, Podicepidiformes, and Suliformes for which we used the maximum observed distance for each species. Truncating the data allowed us to use bird detections over a consistent plot size and ensured that the points were independent (points were spread 250 m apart), which in turn allowed us to estimate θ (the proportion of points occupied within each sampling unit) (Pavlacky Jr., Blakesley, White, Hanni, & Lukacs, 2012). The interpretation of θ for species for which we used maximum distances changes from occupancy to use because point count buffers overlap, but we chose this approach to provide estimates for a larger number of species.\nWe expected regional differences in the behavior, habitat use, and local abundance of species would correspond to regional variation in detection and the fraction of occupied points. Therefore, we estimated the proportion of sampling units occupied (ψ) for each stratum by estimating BCR-by-year specific estimates of detection (p) and point-level occupancy (θ). We fixed p and θ to 0 for BCRs in which a particular species was never detected.\nWe fixed ψ to 0 for all strata in which the species was never detected. As with density, we took an area-weighted mean of stratum-level occupancy estimates (i.e.,ψ) to estimate superstratum-level occupancy probabilities. The true point-level occupancy state was conditional on the grid-cell-level occupancy state (i.e., occupied or unoccupied), such that a point could only be occupied if the grid cell was occupied. Finally, we modeled the observation process conditional on the point being occupied using removal modeling.\nOur application of the multi-scale model was analogous to a within-season robust design (Pollock, 1982) where the two-minute intervals at each point were the secondary samples for estimating p and the points were the primary samples for estimating θ (Nichols et al., 2008; Pavlacky Jr. et al., 2012). We considered both p and θ to be nuisance variables that were important for generating unbiased estimates of ψ. θ can be considered an availability parameter or the probability a species was present and available for sampling at the points (Nichols et al., 2008; Pavlacky Jr. et al., 2012).\n\n\nAutomated Analysis\nIn 2019, we updated our analytical methods to use Bayesian hierarchical models specifically designed for analysis of IMBCR data. We performed all data and output manipulation in R (R Core Team, 2022) and model fitting in JAGS (Plummer 2003, 2017) using the R package jagsUI (Kellner 2018). The R code called the raw data from the IMBCR Structured Query Language (SQL) server database and reformatted the data into a form usable with the JAGS code. We allowed the input of all data collected in a manner consistent with the IMBCR design to increase the number of detections available for estimating global detection rates for population density and site occupancy. The R code provided an automated framework for combining stratum-level estimates of population density and site occupancy at multiple spatial scales, as well as estimating the standard deviations and credible intervals for the combined estimates.\nWe fit initial models to all species with at least 30 detections for density estimation and 10 detections for occupancy estimation. For density estimation, we fit the full model after determining whether there were enough detections based on results from the detection-only model fits. In some cases for both density and occupancy estimation, it was necessary to use a less parsimonious detection structure or simplified model structure to facilitate model convergence. We currently maintain version control of the automated analysis code in the Bird Conservancy repository on www.github.com."

Please see the associated Read Me document for an explanation of columns in the trend estimates spreadsheet. If you cannot access Google Drive, please contact Jennifer Timmer for a copy of the data.\nWe do not include trend estimates for species with zero detections in a given stratum. Please use caution when interpreting trends for low-density species at the superstratum (regional) level when there were zero detections in a given year. In these cases, we add a very small number to the estimate (i.e., half the minimum non-zero estimate) in order to take the log of the estimate. This increases uncertainty around the trend estimates."

    "text": "Number of Species with Estimates\nThe way we present density and occupancy estimates in the final report has changed from years prior to 2018. In the past, if a species had been detected in a stratum in a previous year, but was not detected in the current year, we did not provide density or occupancy estimates for that species in that stratum. We now include estimates for these species. In these cases, the estimate for a given year is zero or very close to zero. We consider these to be legitimate estimates of zero occupancy or density because the species occurs in the area of interest, but was not detected in a particular year.\nThis change means that the number of species with density or occupancy estimates for a given stratum or superstratum in a given year is not comparable to the number of species with estimates for that stratum or superstratum and year in reports prior to 2018. The number of species in the current report will include species with zero, or near zero estimates, if that species has been detected in previous years, whereas reports before 2018 will not. Therefore, there may be more species with estimates for a given stratum in a final report for 2018 and later."

The IMBCR program accommodates the principles of adaptive monitoring (Lindenmayer & Likens, 2009) because it:\n\naddresses well-defined and tractable questions\n\nis underpinned by rigorous science\nis based on a conceptual model of how bird populations function and\n\nis relevant to the management of natural resources (Pavlacky et al., 2017).\n\nUnder the adaptive monitoring framework, the objectives, sampling design, data collection, analysis, and interpretation are iterative, allowing the program to evolve and develop in response to new information or new management questions. The IMBCR program allows for different stratification schemes across states and regions and the re-stratification of local management units to better address partner management objectives or new questions. The flexible hierarchical design also accommodates annual fluctuation of sampling intensity without compromising regional population estimates. In addition, overlay projects can address specific management questions or hypotheses without affecting the integrity of the overall IMBCR framework."

    "section": "Using IMBCR Trend Estimates to Track Species of Concern",
    "text": "Using IMBCR Trend Estimates to Track Species of Concern\nLong-term, rigorous monitoring provides valuable information on population status, allowing managers and biologists to focus limited resources on species of greatest concern. Monitoring populations at local and regional scales also facilitates a mechanistic understanding of how local and regional processes may interact and affect populations (Hewett et al. 2007, Pavlacky et al. 2017). Here we provide a few examples demonstrating the use of IMBCR population trends for tracking the status of designated species of concern and determining where specific populations may require management or conservation efforts.\n\nWyoming BLM\nWe have been monitoring birds across the state of Wyoming since 2009, including all BLM land. Currently, Brewer’s sparrow, sage thrasher, and sagebrush sparrow are listed sensitive species for the Wyoming BLM. Due to the loss and degradation of sagebrush rangelands over the last century, many avian species associated with this biome have also declined and are now of conservation concern (Knick and Rotenberry 2002).\nThroughout all BLM land in Wyoming, populations for these three species are stable-to-increasing across the monitoring period (2009-2022; Figure 20.1), illustrating the overall value of these publicly managed lands for sagebrush birds (Table 3).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.1: Density of three sagebrush-associated species across all BLM land in Wyoming from 2009-2022, illustrating stable to increasing population change.\n\n\n\nWithin several specific BLM field offices, however, populations for these three species are decreasing and may require specific management or conservation efforts to restore sagebrush rangelands. For example, the Brewer’s sparrow population is decreasing approximately 6% each year in the Lander Field Office, the sagebrush sparrow sparrow population is decreasing 19% per year in the Lander Field Office, and the sage thrasher population in the Worland Field Office is decreasing 5% each year (Table 3).\n \n\nTable 3. Population trend estimates for sensitive sagebrush bird species within select Wyoming Bureau of Land Management strata from the IMBCR program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBird Conservation Region 17\nWe have also monitored across the Badlands and Prairies Bird Conservation Region (BCR 17) since 2009. Grassland birds are among the fastest declining group of birds in North America (Rosenberg et al. 2019, NABCI 2022). Grassland prairie converted for cropland or residential development threatens these populations on both the breeding and wintering grounds (NABCI 2016), and the loss may be as high as 700 million breeding individuals over the past 50 years (Rosenberg et al. 2019).\nFor the Northern Great Plains Joint Venture, the chestnut-collared longspur and Sprague’s pipit are focal species of conservation concern, and are declining across this region (17% each year for chestnut-collared longspur and 26% each year for Sprague’s pipit; Table 4). However, if we look at specific management units in BCR17, local populations for these species are actually increasing: chestnut-collared longspur by 4% each year on Cedar River National Grassland in North Dakota and Sprague’s pipit by 17% each year on Grand River National Grassland in South Dakota (Table 4).\n \n\nTable 4. Population trend estimates for two grassland bird species within Bird Conservation Region 17 from the IMBCR program. {#sec-table-4}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nGrassland birds often show low site fidelity from year-to-year as they track suitable breeding sites (Cody 1985), emphasizing the need for regional monitoring to identify these important breeding locations and to track population change over time. In addition, the monitoring data serve as a logical place to form hypotheses for observed population fluctuations and predictions about bird response to drivers of change (Pavlacky et al. 2017). For example, we could model abiotic and biotic habitat features relevant for grassland birds to understand population discrepancies between regional and local scales.\n\n\nUSFS Rocky Mountain Region\nThe USFS Rocky Mountain Region has been involved in IMBCR since the beginning in 2008, so we now have 15 years of monitoring data across this region. Cassin’s sparrow and olive-sided flycatcher are designated sensitive species for the Rocky Mountain Region because of concern about the population viability of these species on USFS land within the region (USFS Manual 2670.5).\nCassin’s sparrows are actually increasing across national grasslands in this region (5% each year; Figure 20.2), and olive-sided flycatchers are also increasing about 4% each year across national forests in the region (Table 5). It’s important to look at trends within specific units, however, because populations may show variable trends locally and could warrant a designation as Species of Conservation Concern (36 CFR § 219.19).\n \n\nTable 5. Population trend estimates for sensitive species within select U.S. Forest Service National Grassland and National Forest strata from the IMBCR program. {#sec-table-5}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFor instance, olive-sided flycatchers are decreasing 19% each year on the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests, but increasing 35% per year on the Shoshone National Forest (Table 5). Populations of western forest species may be stable overall, but forests with a greater departure from historical conditions shaped by frequent fire activity could be hotspots for avian population declines (NABCI 2022).\nCassin’s sparrows are decreasing 11% each year on Cimarron National Grassland, but increasing 3% each year on Comanche National Grassland (Table 5; Figure 20.2). Although many grassland birds breed on privately owned land, publicly managed grasslands also provide critical breeding habitat.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.2: Density of Cassin’s sparrows on Comanche National Grassland, Cimarron National Grassland, and all national grasslands in USFS Region 2 from 2008-2022 (2016-2022 for Cimarron only), illustrating variable population trends at local and regional scales."

    "title": "21  Conclusions",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The availability of consistent monitoring data at multiple scales is an important challenge for avian conservation (Ruth et al., 2003). The IMBCR program meets this challenge through its probabilistic, nested design, which allows for inference to multiple scales of interest, from National Grasslands to states to BCRs (Pavlacky et al., 2017). With this design, we can model habitat relationships to evaluate species’ responses to local management actions and predict species’ distributions for landscape prioritization. Stratification based on eco-regional boundaries and other fixed attributes is also a critical feature of the IMBCR program because it allows for the evaluation of long-term avian responses to landscape and climate change (Metzger et al., 2013; Pavlacky et al., 2017).\nThe importance of long-term population monitoring at larger spatial scales is well known (Jones, 2011; Thompson et al., 1998), but it is often cost-prohibitive. The IMBCR program reduces expenses through cooperation with multiple partners, one of the stated goals of effective collaboration and coordinated bird monitoring (NABCI Monitoring Subcommittee, 2007), and also through efficiencies in data collection and analyses. Partners can investigate priority species and management questions with slight modifications to the IMBCR design, further reducing costs associated with developing new studies and monitoring programs. These cost savings allow for an increased sampling effort and/or for the development of decision support tools to aid land managers and conservation practitioners on the ground. Based on the spatially balanced design, the IMBCR program can also accommodate a shortage of monitoring funds in certain years or strata without reducing the overall rigor of the program (Stevens Jr. & Olsen, 2004).\nThe IMBCR program is well-positioned to address the conservation and management needs of a wide range of stakeholders due to its rigorous, hierarchical design and the strength of the IMBCR partnership. This partnership is an ongoing collaboration between multiple entities from state and federal agencies to non-governmental organizations and Joint Ventures, and was created to address management and conservation objectives of larger avian programs like NABCI (NABCI Monitoring Subcommittee, 2007). Through the IMBCR partnership, monitoring resources are pooled, creating efficiencies and allowing for inference to larger landscapes (Pavlacky et al., 2017). By providing essential knowledge of bird populations at multiple scales relevant to management and conservation, the IMBCR program informs prioritization of management actions and facilitates a collaborative approach to bird conservation (Ruth et al., 2003, Pavlacky et al., 2017)."

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nAll results, including parameter estimates, distribution maps, raw count data and effort, are available online. To view interactive maps showing survey and detection locations, as well as species counts, and density, population and occupancy results using the IMBCR study design please visit the Rocky Mountain Avian Data Center. Click on the “Explore the Data” tab to view IMBCR results.\n\nSelecting filters\nThe Rocky Mountain Avian Data Center has been designed to provide information for specific questions and therefore works best when users select multiple filters for a query.\nTo run a query, click the arrow for the drop down “Filter” menu (located in the extreme upper left corner of the screen) and select one of the following filter types: Study Design, BCR, State, County, Management Entity, Priority Species List, Species, Year, Superstratum, or Individual Stratum. After selecting the filter type, click the “Add” button immediately to the right of the drop down menu. A box will appear with options for the filter that you may select. Use the drop down menu in the box to select the specific filter and then click “Add filter”.\nThe selected filter will appear near the top of the screen. Users may add multiple filter types to view results for a very specific inquiry (e.g., to view IMBCR results for BRSP in CO you would apply the following filters: Study Design = IMBCR, Species = Brewer’s Sparrow and State = CO) or to view multiple outputs at once (e.g., to view data and results for Brewer’s Sparrow and Vesper Sparrow at the same time select Species = Brewer’s Sparrow and Species = Vesper Sparrow). Below is an explanation of the different filter types you may choose from.\nStudy Design: This filter will allow users to select data and results for IMBCR, GRTS, Migration Phenology, NEON, or NPS study designs.\n\n\nSelecting the GRTS filter will display data and results for monitoring efforts which used the IMBCR design but do NOT contribute to statewide and regional estimates (also known as “overlays”).\nThe IMBCR filter will select data and results collected under the IMBCR protocol that contribute to state and BCR-wide estimates.\nThe Migration Phenology filter will select data and results for the Migration Phenology project.\nThe NEON study design is a specific study design developed by NEON and Bird Conservancy for surveys conducted at NEON research locations.\nThe NPS study designs are a mixture of study designs specifically designed for individual national parks. Please note that we are still working on adding some of the historic data to the Avian Data Center so not all study designs are currently available.\n\n\nBCR: This filter will allow users to select data and results for a particular Bird Conservation Region. Selecting this filter will provide you with results for all strata and superstrata within a particular BCR.\nState: This filter will allow users to select data and results for all study designs for a particular state. Selecting this filter will supply the user with data and results for all strata and superstrata within a particular state.\nCounty: This filter will allow users to select data for a particular county. Please note that only raw count data and survey locations are available at the county level.\nPriority Species List: This filter will allow users to select data and results for multiple species at once. The query will display data and results for all species included on the selected management indicator list, species of conservation concern list, etc.\nSpecies: This filter allows users to select data and results for a particular species.\nYear: This filter will allow users to select all data and results for a particular year.\nSuperstratum: This filter allows users to select IMBCR data and results for multiple strata that were analyzed jointly (e.g., the entire Bridger-Teton National Forest which was broken up into 2 strata or the entire state of Colorado which was broken up into 30 strata).\nManagement Entity: This filter will allow users to select data and results for All Other Lands, Colorado State Land Board, The Nature Conservancy (TNC), US Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), US Bureau of Land Management (BLM), US Department of Defense (DOD), US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), US Forest Service (USFS), or National Park Service (NPS). Once a management entity is chosen, users may notice that additional filter types are available in the filters drop down list. These additional filter types, listed from most general to most specific, are management regions (e.g., USFS Region 1), management units (e.g., Dakota Prairie Grasslands), management forests (e.g., Shoshone National Forest), or management districts (e.g., North Kaibab district within Kaibab National Forest). Below is the filter hierarchy for the different management entities.\nHierarchy for the different management entities\n\nAll Other Lands:\nTier One – Management Entity – All Other Lands\nTier Two – Management Region – n/a\nTier Three – Management Unit – n/a\nTier Four – National Forest or Grassland – n/a\nTier Five – Management District – n/a\nColorado State Land Board:\nTier One – Management Entity – Colorado State Land Board\nTier Two – Management Region – Lowry Range\nTier Three – Management Unit – n/a\nTier Four – National Forest or Grassland – n/a\nTier Five – Management District – n/a\nTNC:\nTier One – Management Entity – The Nature Conservancy\nTier Two – Management Region – Cherry Creek\nTier Three – Management Unit – n/a\nTier Four – National Forest or Grassland – n/a\nTier Five – Management District – n/a\nTribal Lands:\nTier One – Management Entity – US Bureau of Indian Affairs\nTier Two – Management Region – Reservation\nTier Three – Management Unit – n/a\nTier Four – National Forest or Grassland – n/a\nTier Five – Management District – n/a\nBLM:\nTier One – Management Entity – Bureau of Land Management\nTier Two – Management Region – BLM Field Office\nTier Three – Management Unit – n/a\nTier Four – National Forest or Grassland – n/a\nTier Five – Management District – n/a\nDOD:\nTier One – Management Entity – US Department of Defense\nTier Two – Management Region – US DoD Installation\nTier Three – Management Unit – n/a\nTier Four – National Forest or Grassland – n/a\nTier Five – Management District – n/a\nUSFWS:\nTier One – Management Entity – US Fish and Wildlife Service\nTier Two – Management Region – USFWS Region Tier Three – Management Unit – USFWS Management Unit, Refuge, etc.\nTier Four – National Forest or Grassland – n/a Tier Five – Management District – n/a\nUSFS:\nTier One – Management Entity – US Forest Service\nTier Two – Management Region – USFS Regions\nTier Three – Management Unit – National Forest (NF) or National Grassland (NG) management units (used to represent situations where multiple forests are managed jointly)\nTier Four – National Forest or Grassland – NF or NG\nTier Five – Management District – NF or NG Ranger Districts\nNPS:\nTier One – Management Entity – National Park Service\nTier Two – Management Region – Inventory and Monitoring Network\nTier Three – Management Unit – Individual NPS Parks, Monuments, Memorials, Recreation Areas, and Historic Sites\nTier Four – Management Forest – n/a\nTier Five – Management District – n/a\n\nClearing Filters\nFilters can be cleared in one of two ways. You may click on the circled “X” to the left of an individual filter at the top of the screen to remove it or you may click the “clear all filters” button at the top of the screen to start building a new query.\nRunning Queries\nOnce you have selected your desired filters, please click on the “Run Query” button located at the top of the screen. The amount of time it takes for the desired data and results to be displayed will depend on how specific your query is.\nComparing Multiple Queries\nUsers may view results of multiple queries at once. To do this, run the first query as described above and then click the button “New Query Window” (located at the top of the screen). A new window will appear where a separate query can be run. The two windows can then be viewed side by side.\nShare a Created Query with a Colleague\nIt is possible to create a link to the Avian Data Center/ Explore the Data screen with a pre-loaded set of filters for a query. To do this, add the custom set of filters for your query per the instructions above and then click the “Generate URL” button near the top right corner of the screen. A pop-up box will appear with a highlighted URL address. Once you copy the highlighted text, you may paste the URL address into an email or document using conventional means. Please note that whoever receives the URL address will need to run the query after clicking on the link to see the survey locations, results, and raw count statistics for the set of filters of interest."

After clicking the “Run Query” button, the ADC will display a map of all survey locations corresponding to your set of filters (surveyed sampling units are represented by blue semi-transparent circles) using Google Maps. If you have filtered by species, blue circles represent survey locations where that species was not detected and blue circles with a pink dot in the center represent survey locations where that species was detected. To see the specific name of a survey location, hover the mouse arrow over the blue circle. After a moment the name of the surveyed sampling unit will appear. You may view the bird detection information for a sampling unit and the survey dates by left clicking your mouse on the blue circle.\nBy default, the zoom capability of the maps page is restricted to protect the privacy of private landowners. Funding and/or implementation partners wishing for more precise location information to be displayed should request a password from Bird Conservancy IT staff via email. Once a user has a password, click on the “View Options” button at the top of the screen, enter the password in the “Password for Bird Conservancy staff and partners” field, and click “Save”. If you have run a query prior to entering the password, you will need to click the “Run Query” button again in order to utilize the enhanced zooming features now available to you.\nAdding map layers\nYou may add the following layers to the map: Bird Conservation Region boundaries, BIA boundaries, DoD boundaries, NPS boundaries, USFS boundaries and BLM Field Office boundaries. To do this, left click on the drop down menu at the top left corner of the map, select the desired layer, and click the “add layer” button. It is possible to add multiple layers to the map by repeating this process. The top-most feature’s name will appear if you left click your mouse inside the layer’s boundaries."

    "text": "Viewing Occupancy/Density Results (Occupancy and Density Tabs)\nViewing Tables\nYou may view occupancy or density results table and a chart for all appropriate strata (based on the set of filters) for which we have results, by clicking on the tabs labeled “Occupancy” or “Density”. These tabs are located just below the drop down filter menu in the upper left corner of the screen. The occupancy tables display species, stratum, year, Psi (proportion of sampling units expected to be occupied), number of sampling units the species was detected on, standard error (SE) of the estimate, the percent coefficient of variation (% CV). The density tables will display species, stratum, year, number of birds estimated per km² (D), total number of individuals estimated within the stratum (N), percent coefficient of variation (% CV), and the number of independent detections used in analyses (n). You may view a description of the column headings by moving the cursor over the column heading.\nViewing the Charts\nWhen viewing the occupancy and density charts, the point estimate of Psi or D is indicated with a dot. Additionally, short horizontal dashes above and below the point estimate represent values one standard error away from the point estimate. To view the species, stratum and year that correspond to an estimate on the chart, simply move your mouse arrow over the point estimate or standard error bar. A message will pop up with the appropriate information. If you have queried out multiple years of data, the point estimates for each year will be connected with a solid line. You may remove an individual estimate from the chart by clicking on the corresponding row of the table on the left side of the screen. Estimates that are not displayed on the chart will turn a peach color in the table. You may add the estimate back onto the chart by clicking on the peach colored row in the table.\nKnowing which species have estimates\nTo restrict the species filter to display only those species for which occupancy and/or density estimates have been produced, click on the “View Options” button on the very top of the screen and then check the box next to “Only show species for which occupancy/density results are available”. This will prevent you from querying out numerous species for which occupancy or density estimates are not available.\nSaving results of your query\nYou may easily save the results of your query by clicking the “Copy to clipboard” button and pasting the results into another program such as excel or by clicking the “Save to CSV” button. Similarly, to save a chart click on the “View Image” button below the chart, right click on anywhere on the image and select “Copy image” or “Save image as”.\nFunctionality\nPlease keep in mind that queries with very generic filters will result in long wait times and may not function optimally (your browser may end up crashing). For instance, if a user selects only the IMBCR filter, occupancy results will be displayed for every species and strata/superstrata combination for which there are occupancy and/or density results. If your query is not specific enough, the chart on the right side of the screen will not be displayed or a pop-up box will appear asking if you would like to continue. This pop-up box is designed to prevent your web browser from crashing while the RMADC attempts to create a chart that would be extremely difficult to interpret. We recommend that you cancel the proposed query and add additional filters to make your query less generic."

Both the counts (left table) and effort tables (right table) may be sorted by clicking on the row header. Additionally, you may view the counts and effort by BCR, State, County, Stratum, or Management Entity by clicking on the “Count by” drop down menu located above the counts table. If you have filtered using “Superstrata”, viewing counts by Stratum is an excellent way of getting a list of all the strata that comprise a Superstratum.

To correct this, all strata in the Colorado and Wyoming portions of BCR 16 were re-stratified without cell weighting. Additionally, the All Other Lands stratum in Wyoming BCR 16 was split into two strata: All Other Lands and BLM Lands.\nBased on the overall success of the pilot implementation, IMBCR expanded to include the Colorado and Wyoming portions of the Northern Rockies (BCR 10); the Great Basin (BCR 9) and BCR 18 portions of Wyoming; all of the Badlands and Prairies (BCR 17); the USFS National Forests and Grasslands within BCR 18; and Coconino and Prescott National Forests in the Sierra Madre Occidental (BCR 34)."

Additionally, there were several re-stratifications done in Colorado BCRs 10 and 16 between 2009 and 2010. The Colorado BCR 10 stratum was re-stratified to include the small easternmost portion of BCR 10 that dips into Colorado so all Colorado BCR 10 lands are represented. The “NPS Rocky Mountain Inventory and Monitoring Network (RMNW)” and “Northern Colorado Plateau Inventory and Monitoring Network (NCPN)” were re-stratified because some NCPN park units were initially misclassified into the RMNW stratum. In Wyoming, the USFS Region 4 stratum was re-stratified into three separate strata: “Bridger-Teton National Forest front-country/managed areas”, “Bridger-Teton National Forest designated roadless/wilderness areas” and “the remainder of USFS Region 4 lands in Wyoming BCR 10”. This re-stratification was done to allow for density and occupancy estimation specifically for the Bridger-Teton National Forest."

Additionally, there were several re-stratifications done in Colorado. The Colorado BCR 10 stratum was split into two strata: BLM Lands and All Other Lands. This was done to facilitate improved tracking of priority species on BLM lands throughout Colorado. Rio Grande National Forest and White River National Forest strata were each split into three strata: low, medium, and high elevations. This stratification by elevation allowed sampling intensity changes to target Management Indicator Species on the forests. The Routt National Forest and Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests strata were reorganized and a third stratum, the Williams Fork Area, was created from the two because it had mixed administration between the Routt National Forest and the Arapahoe and Roosevelt National Forests.\nThe RMNW stratum was re-stratified to accurately reflect land ownership. There was a land acquisition within Great Sand Dunes National Monument and some samples were removed from Rio Grande National Forest and added to the RMNW stratum; 16 km² were added to the area of the RMNW strata. In South Dakota, the Black Hills National Forest stratum was split into two strata based on watersheds in the Forest: Hydrologic Code 7 Watersheds and all other watersheds. Stratification by watershed allows for adjusting sampling intensity to target Management Indicator Species on the Forest."

We took into account the boundary between USFS Regions 1 and 4, which runs through Idaho, when stratifying so estimates could be generated at the USFS Region level. The new strata include “All Other Lands in the Region 1 portion of Idaho BCR 10” (all lands outside of national forest boundaries), “All Other Lands in the Region 4 portion of Idaho BCR 10” (all lands outside of national forest boundaries), “other USFS lands in the Region 1 portion of Idaho BCR 10” and “USFS designated roadless/wilderness areas within the Region 4 portion of Idaho BCR 10”. In Arizona, Tonto National Forest became a part of the IMBCR survey effort. The forest was stratified into two strata based on elevation to allow sampling intensity changes to target Management Indicator Species on the Forests. Kaibab National Forest was re-stratified into two strata based on elevation for the same reason. In Montana, several strata were re-stratified and combined within BCR 17. The three “All Other Lands” strata were combined with the “Tribal Lands” stratum into one “All Other Lands” stratum. The four BLM strata within Montana BCR 17 were combined into one BLM stratum. These strata were collapsed into larger strata to maximize the number of samples conducted within two strata rather than spread them out amongst eight strata."

    "section": "2013",
    "text": "2013\n2013 brought significant changes to the program’s overall stratification methods. The original IMBCR sampling grids were created at the state scale and as the program expanded, additional sampling grids were created at the BCR scale. In response to a rapidly growing monitoring program, the partnership acknowledged the need for a standard national grid system to promote the coordination and application of monitoring data in conservation. The group proposed the use of the United States National Grid (USNG), a national grid system created by the Federal Geographic Data Committee, as its standard. There are three advantages to using the USNG. First, the use of standard grids allows for the integration of datasets and subsequent identification of areas where sampling should or has not occurred. Second, it provides a means to identify sampled areas in a consistent manner so results of monitoring projects can be evaluated in a spatially comparable way. Lastly, it facilitates regional and national-level avian distribution modeling and the development of broad-scale avian distribution maps. This standard was approved by the NABCI committee. Bird Conservancy started using the USNG for new stratification and re-stratification schemes in 2013.\nWe added several USFS strata to the sampling frame for the 2013 field season – Coronado National Forest in southern Arizona, Carson National Forest in north-central New Mexico, and Caribou-Targhee National Forest in southeastern Idaho. Coronado and Carson National Forests were stratified into two strata based on elevation to allow for adjusting sampling intensity to target Management Indicator Species on the Forests. Because Caribou-Targhee National Forest spans three states and three BCRs, it was necessary to divide the forest into four strata. The state and BCR-level stratification distinctions allowed the summation of the data for individual states or BCRs. The four new strata in Idaho and Utah join a preexisting Caribou-Targhee stratum in west-central Wyoming as a part of Wyoming’s statewide effort. In addition, Pawnee National Grassland was split into two strata – public lands and private lands – since Pawnee National Grassland contains a large amount of private land within its administrative boundary. This allowed the USFS to concentrate more survey effort specifically on public lands. In Wyoming, the preexisting stratum in BCR 10 containing all USFS Region 4 lands (other than Bridger-Teton National Forest) was re-stratified into three separate strata, one for each Forest (Caribou-Targhee, Ashley, and Wasatch). This allows for forest-wide estimates within Caribou-Targhee National Forest. If, in the future, Ashley and Wasatch National Forests are completely sampled, this will also allow for forest-wide estimates in each of those forests.\nThe North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska portions of BCR 17 underwent a complete re-stratification to incorporate several NPS Northern Great Plains Inventory and Monitoring Network (NGPN) strata. All of the non-NPS strata in these states were retained, but renamed to avoid confusion. The NPS strata were stratified by NPS unit to allow the NGPN to monitor birds on each of its units separately. New strata included Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site, Theodore Roosevelt National Park, Badlands National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, Mount Rushmore National Monument, and Wind Cave National Park.\nNebraska BCR 18 also underwent a complete re-stratification to allow for the individual stratification of Agate Fossil Beds and Scotts Bluff National Monuments. We also added an additional stratum for Cherry Ranch, a property owned by The Nature Conservancy (TNC)."

    "text": "2014\nIn Colorado, the Arapaho and Roosevelt and the Pike and San Isabel National Forests were re-stratified to allow these forests to monitor treatments intended to mitigate fire hazard and improve forest health. We divided each forest into two strata: a control stratum and the remainder of the forest. The control portion of the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests consists of lands ranging in elevation from 6,000 ft. (1,829 m) to 9,000 ft. (2,743 m) and excludes treatment areas and areas burned between 1998 and 2013. The Pike and San Isabel control stratum ranges from 6,000 ft. (1,829 m) to 9,500 ft. (2,896 m) and excludes treatment areas and areas burned between 1998 and 2013. We created a single experiment overlay stratum for all of Arapaho and Roosevelt and Pike and San Isabel National Forests consisting of actual treatment areas (areas with >30% treatment). Since this stratum spans multiple forests, it is not considered to be a part of the IMBCR design; however, detections from this stratum do contribute to the number of detections used in analyses.\nSignificant stratification changes were made to the BCR 10 portion of Idaho. The four strata defined in the 2012 field season were further subdivided into nine strata. The boundary between USFS Regions 1 and 4 runs through Idaho and was taken into account when re-stratifying so that estimates could be generated at the USFS Region level. The new strata created in Idaho BCR 10 include the “Idaho portion of Bitterroot National Forest”, “BLM Lands within Idaho BCR10”, “Boise National Forest”, “the Idaho portion of Kootenai National Forest”, “Payette National Forest”, “Salmon-Challis National Forest”, “Sawtooth National Forest”, “All other Lands within Idaho BCR 10 and USFS Region 1” (all lands outside of national forest and BLM boundaries) and “All Other Lands within Idaho BCR 10 and USFS Region 4” (all lands outside of national forest and BLM boundaries). Since Bitterroot and Kootenai National Forests span Idaho and Montana, 2014 density and occupancy estimates for those forests included strata from both states. In the past, “forest-wide” estimates have only represented the Montana portion of these forests.\nWe subdivided the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) strata in Montana BCRs 11 and 17 to allow density and occupancy estimation specifically within the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge. Previously, we grouped all USFWS lands together in these BCRs, limiting estimates for individual refuges. In each BCR, we created two new strata – a Charles M. Russel NWR stratum and an “All Other USFWS Lands” stratum.\nIn addition to re-stratification, we added a few new strata to the IMBCR program in 2014. In Nebraska, NGPN began monitoring on the Niobrara National Scenic River spanning BCRs 17 and 19. In Utah, we created a new stratum for Manti-La Sal National Forest. Previously, only the Colorado portion of Manti-La Sal was stratified and surveyed. The additional Utah portion allows for the generation of forest-wide estimates for Manti-La Sal."

    "text": "2015\nIn 2015, the Department of Defense (DoD) stratum in Colorado BCR 18 was completely re-stratified as part of a DoD Legacy Resource Management Program Grant to represent six individual military installations: US Air Force Academy, Fort Carson, Pueblo Chemical Depot, Piñon Canyon, and All Other DoD Lands. This DoD installation-level stratification allows for the generation of density and occupancy estimates for each installation. Fort Carson and Piñon Canyon were further stratified by areas within range fans (training zones) and areas outside of range fans to allow the DoD to assess the effects of military training on bird species.\nThe Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge stratum also came out of the 2015 re-stratification. During WWII, the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, as it was originally known, was a chemical weapons manufacturing facility. At the time of the 2008 IMBCR stratification in the state Colorado, it was still partially owned by the US Army and was included in the DoD stratum. The refuge is now in its own individual stratum.\nThe IMBCR program expanded to include the Missouri National Recreational River (MNRR), part of the NPS NGPN in Nebraska and South Dakota. There are two strata for MNRR representing the 39 Mile District and the 59 Mile District. In Utah, an additional stratum was added for Sanpitch Recreation Area. This area is part of Uinta National Forest but administered by Manti-La Sal National Forest and will be incorporated into forest-wide estimates for Manti-La Sal National."

    "text": "2016\nIn 2016, the Playa Lakes Joint Venture (PLJV) coordinated a partnership between several state wildlife agencies and Bird Conservancy to expand sampling in five of the joint venture’s six states: Nebraska, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. PLJV’s sixth state, Colorado, was already included in the IMBCR program starting in 2008. This expansion now provides the program with nearly complete coverage of two BCRs that were only sparsely covered in past years: Shortgrass Prairie (BCR 18) and Central Mixed Grass Prairie (BCR 19). The BCR 18 and 19 portions of these 5 states were divided into several strata, including, playas, rivers, biologically unique landscapes in Nebraska, and all other lands.\nThe IMBCR program also underwent a major expansion into the state of Utah in 2016. The entire state was stratified into BLM, USFS, DoD, and All Other Lands strata. This year was somewhat of a pilot year, with select BLM, USFS, DoD, and all other lands strata sampled across the state. In future years, sampling will be increased to a statewide level.\nIn addition to new strata, some existing strata were re-stratified for a variety of reasons. In North and South Dakota, we re-stratified the Tribal and All Other Lands strata to ensure all tribal lands were only included in the tribal lands strata. In the past, some tribal lands could still be found within the All Other Lands strata. We also re-stratified Cimarron, Kiowa, and Rita Blanca National Grasslands in Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. With the expansion of IMBCR throughout the PLJV region, these strata needed to be fit to the US National Grid to make them consistent with the rest of the IMBCR program in the region. In addition, we determined that the portion of Rita Blanca National Grassland that fell in New Mexico was actually managed by Kiowa National Grassland, so that portion was moved to the Kiowa National Grasslands stratum. All DoD lands in Colorado BCR18 were combined into one stratum. This was the same stratification used prior to 2015."

    "text": "2010\nBeginning in 2010, the point count duration was increased from five minutes to six minutes to facilitate occupancy estimation, which is easier to analyze using equal time intervals (in this case, two minutes each). Observers began recording juvenile birds detected during point counts. Observers placed a “J” in the sex column for these detections. Previously, juvenile birds were not recorded because this study focuses on recording breeding birds. Juvenile bird detections are used for distribution mapping purposes only and are not factored into data analysis. A minute column was added to the bird datasheet so observers could record the actual minute of each bird detection during a point count. Previously, observers used tick marks to separate minute intervals. We added a “visual” checkbox to the bird datasheet for observers to check if they visually observed and identified any of the species recorded. This reminds observers that they need to look for birds in addition to listening for them and helps crew leaders make decisions regarding unusual or rare bird detections while proofing data. We provided observers with an additional datasheet to record the reasons points were not surveyed (e.g., weather issues, unsafe terrain, denied permission by landowner, etc.). This sheet also provided space to record additional landowner information as needed. Lastly, observers began recording horizontal distance to each flyover detection. In the past, we did not record distances because we do not use flyover detections in analysis. However, observers sometimes incorrectly distinguish flyovers from birds using the surrounding habitat while foraging on the wing (e.g., swallows, swifts, and raptors). Therefore, if we find an incorrectly recorded flyover, we can still use the detection data in analysis."

    "text": "2012\nIn 2012, observers began recording the start time for every point count conducted so we could use temporal information as a variable in analyses. Start times for the entire transect and for individual points were all recorded in Mountain Daylight Time for consistency across the region. Prior to 2012, observers were allowed to conduct point counts until 11:00 AM local time each day. In order to account for variability across study areas from Arizona to Montana, crew leaders instructed observers to survey no later than five hours after sunrise in 2012. Observers also began noting migrant detections on surveys. After the field season, we thoroughly review the migrant records; if those records are verified, they are not included in analysis. Previously, crew leaders instructed observers to record a bird as a male if 1) it was a singing warbler or sparrow, or 2) it was singing repeatedly and emphatically. In 2012, we instructed observers to only identify the sex of a visually observed bird of a sexually dimorphic species. We instructed observers to record subspecies only if they visually identified a bird as such. In the past, we used geographic range to assume a bird was of a particular subspecies. Up until the 2012 field season, we provided observers with a list of rare or difficult to detect species to record while traveling between points within a sampling unit. In 2012, in order to simplify the protocol and collect more useful information, we eliminated the list and observers recorded any species they came across while traveling between points they had not documented during a point count. That way all species encountered within the sampling unit would be documented for distribution mapping purposes.\nAlso in 2012, several changes were made to the vegetation datasheet. First, we removed distance to the nearest road, forest structural stage and human structures from the data sheet. We no longer collect these types of data in the field because they can be obtained through remote sensing. Second, we modified the datasheet to simply record whether a mid-story was present. In the past, if mid-story vegetation was present, observers would record the species found in that layer. Data analysis found mid-story vegetation data to be extremely variable from year to year. Third, we added a ground cover category for residual grass. Finally, we limited acceptable overstory, understory, and ground cover relative abundance values to 1%, 5%, or increments of 10%. In the past, observers estimated cover to the nearest percent for all categories where percent cover or relative abundance was recorded. We made the change to improve the consistency of cover and relative abundance estimates and to decrease the amount of time observers spend estimating these values.\nIn 2012, crew leaders provided observers with two additional data sheets to facilitate working on private lands. The first contained specific information about the land ownership of each point located within a given sampling unit. In cases where a point fell on private property, the data sheet contained the name, contact information and any pertinent notes about the landowner. The second data sheet was a contact log where observers recorded all contacts or attempted contacts they had with landowners. This information was later entered into the landowner database when the observer had internet access."

    "text": "Distance Analysis\nDensity and Abundance Estimation\nState process\nWe developed a zero-inflated N-mixture model (Royle 2004, Sillett et al. 2011) to estimate density and abundance for all strata and superstrata across all species with sufficient data. For a given species, the true occupancy state of point count location \\(k\\) in grid \\(j\\), stratum \\(i\\), and year \\(t\\) is distributed\n\\[z_{ijkt} \\sim Bern(ψ_{i}).\\]\nThe number of independent clusters of individuals, \\(N\\), of a given species at point count location \\(k\\) in grid \\(j\\), stratum \\(i\\), and year \\(t\\) came from a Poisson distribution\n\\[N_{ijkt}\\sim Poisson(λ_{ijt}×z_{ijkt})\\]\nwith mean \\(λ_{ijt}\\). Abundances at all points within a grid came from a distribution with the same mean to account for the lack of independence between points, and we modeled \\(λ\\) as a function of time to estimate trend for each stratum:\n\\[log⁡(λ_{ijt}) = α_{i}+r_{i} (t-1)+ε_{j},\\]\nwhere \\(α\\) and \\(r\\) are stratum-specific intercepts and trends, respectively, and \\(ε\\) is a grid-specific random effect.\nTo avoid predicting species occurrence outside of observed ranges, we fixed \\(ψ\\) to 0 for all strata in which the species was never observed and used a prior informed by the observed proportion of grid-year combinations in a stratum in which the species was detected\n\\[logit(ψ_{i }) \\sim Normal(μ_{ψ_i},σ_{ψ}^{2}),\\]\nwhere \\(μ_{ψ_i}\\) is the stratum-specific naïve occupancy and \\(σ_{ψ}^{2}\\) is the annual variation in occupancy probabilities shared across strata. All other parameters had vague priors:\n\\[α\\sim Normal(0,4),\\] \\[exp⁡(r) \\sim Uniform(0.25,1.75),\\]\n\\[ε\\sim Normal(0,σ_{ε}^{2}),\\]\nand\n\\[σ_{ε}^{2}\\sim Uniform(0,5).\\]\nWe derived density, \\(D\\), at the point count location as\n\\[D_{ijkt} = \\frac {(N_{ijkt}×s)}{A_{c}} ,\\]\nwhere \\(A_{c}\\) is the area of the point count circle (see Observation process section below) and s is the cluster size, which was sampled from the distribution\n\\[s\\sim Gamma(k,θ)+1,\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) and \\(θ\\) were derived from the mean and variance of observed cluster sizes. We subtracted 1 from the mean when calculating \\(k\\) and \\(θ\\) and added 1 to the random variable to ensure cluster sizes were \\(\\ge\\) 1. We derived stratum-level density estimates by averaging all point-level density estimates within each stratum, and we took the area-weighted average of strata estimates to obtain superstrata estimates. We required a minimum of 30 detections across the IMBCR effort to estimate density for each species.\nObservation process\nWe estimated the probability of detecting an independent cluster of individuals by fitting distance functions to the distance data collected during surveys (Buckland et al. 2001). We fit four detection models including: 1. half-normal constant \\((HN(.))\\)\n2. hazard rate constant \\((Haz(.))\\)\n3. half-normal year \\((HN(t))\\)\n4. hazard rate year \\((Haz(t))\\).\nWe removed the furthest 10% of observed detection distances from the data set and binned the remaining detections into 10 evenly spaced distance classes. For half-normal functions, we calculated the detection probability, \\(p\\), for each distance class, l, as:\n\\[p_{l} = \\frac {(2π∫_{c=b_{l}}^{c=b_{l+1}}exp⁡(-(\\frac {c^2}{2θ^2} ))c dc)}{A_l}\\]\nwhere \\(b_{l}\\) and \\(b_{l+1}\\) are the cutpoints for \\(l\\), \\(θ\\) is the half-normal shape parameter, and \\(A_{l}\\) is the area of \\(l\\). Because of the lack of an analytical solution to the integral of the hazard rate function, we calculated \\(p\\) at the midpoint, \\(m\\), of each distance class\n\\[p_{l} = 1-exp⁡ (-(\\frac{ m_{l}}{a})^{b} )\\]*\nTo allow detection probabilities to vary by year, we sampled year-specific shape parameters from hyperdistributions:\n\\[θ_{t}\\sim Normal(μ_{θ},σ_{θ}^{2} ),\\]\n\\[a_{t}\\sim Normal(μ_{a},σ_{a}^{2} ),\\]\nand\n\\[b_{t}\\sim Normal(μ_{b},σ_{b}^{2} ),\\]\nwith priors of\n\\[μ_{θ}\\sim Unif(0,1000),\\] \\[μ_{a}\\sim Unif(0,500),\\]\n\\[σ_{θ},σ_{a},μ_{b}\\sim Unif(0,100),\\]\nand\n\\[σ_{b}\\sim Unif(0,25).\\]\nWe then multiplied p_l by the proportional area of l to account for the probability that a cluster is within distance class l and obtain π_l, the probability a cluster is present within distance class l and is detected,\n\\[π_{lt} = \\frac {p_{lt} A_{l}}{∑_{l=1}^{L}A_{l}}.\\]\nWe calculated the overall capture probability, \\(p_{cap}\\), as\n\\[p_{cap} = ∑_{l=1}^{L}π_{l} ,\\]\nand modeled the number of detections in each distance class at each point count location in year \\(t\\) as\n\\[y_{ijkt}\\sim Multinom(π_{t},N_{ijkt} ).\\]\nDetection model selection\nTo find the most parsimonious detection function while minimizing computing time, we fit detection-only models to the distance data, using the four model structures described above. We used the Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC; Watanabe 2010, Hooten and Hobbs 2015) to select the most parsimonious detection structure and then used that structure for detection probabilities in the full model to estimate density and abundance.\nSuperstratum trends\nWe developed a post-hoc approach to estimate trends for superstrata. Using the rolled-up estimates of density for superstratum, i, we fit a general linear model (GLM) to the samples from each Bayesian iteration, m,\n\\[log⁡(\\hat{D}_{itm} )\\sim α_{im}+r_{im} (t-1).\\] Fitting a GLM across iterations allowed us to incorporate uncertainty in trends due to uncertainty around density estimates, but it did not account for temporal variation. To incorporate this second form of variation, we sampled a random intercept \\((α_{im})\\) and slope \\((\\tilde{r}_{im})\\) for each iteration using the mean and standard error estimated using the GLM and made inference on the distribution of the resampled values,\n\\[\\tilde{α}_{im} \\sim Normal(μ_{α_{im}},SE_{α_{im}})\\]\nand\n\\[\\tilde{r}_{im}\\sim Normal(μ_{r_{im}},SE_{r_{im}}).\\]\n\n\nOccupancy Estimation\nOccupancy estimation is most commonly used to quantify the proportion of sample units (i.e., 1 km² cells) occupied by an organism (MacKenzie et al., 2002). The application of occupancy modeling requires multiple surveys of the sample unit in space or time to estimate a detection probability (MacKenzie et al., 2006). The detection probability adjusts the proportion of sites occupied to account for species that were present but undetected (MacKenzie et al., 2002). We used a removal design (MacKenzie et al., 2006) to estimate a detection probability for each species, in which we binned minutes one and two, minutes three and four, and minutes five and six to meet the assumption of a monotonic decline in the detection rates through time. After the target species was detected at a point, we set all subsequent sampling intervals at that point to “missing data” (MacKenzie et al., 2006). We required a minimum of ≥1 detection on 10 different transects across the IMBCR effort to estimate occupancy for each species.\nThe 16 points in each sampling unit served as spatial replicates for estimating the proportion of points occupied within the sampled sampling units. We used a Bayesian, multi-scale occupancy model (Nichols et al. 2008, Mordecai et al. 2011, Green et al. 2019) to estimate 1) the probability of detecting a species given presence (\\(p\\)), 2) the proportion of points occupied by a species given presence within sampled sampling units (\\(θ\\)) and 3) the proportion of sampling units occupied by a species (\\(ψ\\)).\nWe truncated the data, using only detections <125 m from the sample points, except for species in Accipitriformes, Anseriformes, Falconiformes, Galliformes, Gruiformes, Pelecaniformes, Podicepidiformes, and Suliformes for which we used the maximum observed distance for each species. Truncating the data allowed us to use bird detections over a consistent plot size and ensured that the points were independent (points were spread 250 m apart), which in turn allowed us to estimate \\(θ\\) (the proportion of points occupied within each sampling unit) (Pavlacky Jr., Blakesley, White, Hanni, & Lukacs, 2012). The interpretation of \\(θ\\) for species for which we used maximum distances changes from occupancy to use because point count buffers overlap, but we chose this approach to provide estimates for a larger number of species.\nWe expected regional differences in the behavior, habitat use, and local abundance of species would correspond to regional variation in detection and the fraction of occupied points. Therefore, we estimated the proportion of sampling units occupied (\\(ψ\\)) for each stratum by estimating BCR by year specific estimates of detection (\\(p\\)) and point-level occupancy (\\(θ\\)). We fixed \\(p\\) and \\(θ\\) to \\(0\\) for BCRs in which a particular species was never detected. Otherwise these parameters came from hyperdistributions,\n\\[logit(p_{BCR,t}) \\sim Normal(μ_{p_{BCR}},σ_{p}^{2})\\]\nand\n\\[logit(θ_{BCR,t})\\sim Normal(μ_{θ_{BCR}},σ_{θ}^{2}),\\]\nwhere \\(μ_{p}\\) and \\(μ_{θ}\\) are BCR-specific means for detection and point-level occupancy, respectively, and \\(σ_{p}^{2}\\) and \\(σ_{θ}^{2}\\) are the annual variances shared across BCRs.\nWe fixed \\(ψ\\) to 0 for all strata in which the species was never detected. Otherwise, the true occupancy state \\((z_{i,t})\\) of a 1-km2 grid cell, \\(j\\), in a given year, \\(t\\), in stratum \\(i\\) was modeled as\n\\[z_{ijt}\\sim Bernoulli(ψ_{it})\\]\nand\n\\[logit(ψ_{it} )\\sim Normal(μ_{ψ_i},σ_{ψ}^{2}),\\]\nwhere \\(μ_{ψ_i}\\) is the stratum-specific mean occupancy rate on the logit scale and \\(σ_{ψ}^{2}\\) is the annual variance shared across all strata. As with density, we took an area-weighted mean of stratum-level occupancy estimates (i.e., \\(ψ\\)) to estimate superstratum-level occupancy probabilities.\nThe true point-level occupancy state (\\(u\\)) was conditional on the grid-cell-level occupancy state (i.e., z = 1, occupied; z = 0, unoccupied), such that a point could only be occupied if the grid cell was occupied,\n\\[u_{ijkt}\\sim Bernoulli(θ_{BCR,t}×z_{ijt}).\\]\nFinally, we modeled the observation process conditional on the point being occupied (i.e., \\(u\\) = 1) as\n\\[y_{ijkt}\\sim Binomial(p_{BCR,t}×u_{ijkt},J_{ijkt}),\\]\nwhere y_ijkt are the observation data at point \\(k\\) in year \\(t\\) (\\(y\\) =1, observed; \\(y\\) = 0, not observed) and \\(J_{ijkt}\\) is the 2-minute interval in which the species was first detected (i.e., \\(J\\) = 1, 1-2 minutes, \\(J\\) = 2, 3-4 minutes, \\(J\\) =3, 5-6 minutes or not detected).\nOur application of the multi-scale model was analogous to a within-season robust design (Pollock, 1982) where the two-minute intervals at each point were the secondary samples for estimating \\(p\\) and the points were the primary samples for estimating \\(θ\\) (Nichols et al., 2008; Pavlacky Jr. et al., 2012). We considered both \\(p\\) and \\(θ\\) to be nuisance variables that were important for generating unbiased estimates of \\(ψ\\). \\(θ\\) can be considered an availability parameter or the probability a species was present and available for sampling at the points (Nichols et al., 2008; Pavlacky Jr. et al., 2012).\n\n\nAutomated Analysis\nWe updated our analytical methods and are used Bayesian hierarchical models specifically designed for analysis of IMBCR data. We performed all data and output manipulation in R (R Core Team, 2022) and model fitting in JAGS (Plummer 2003, 2017) using the R package jagsUI (Kellner 2018). The R code called the raw data from the IMBCR Structured Query Language (SQL) server database and reformatted the data into a form usable with the JAGS code. We allowed the input of all data collected in a manner consistent with the IMBCR design to increase the number of detections available for estimating global detection rates for population density and site occupancy. The R code provided an automated framework for combining strata-level estimates of population density and site occupancy at multiple spatial scales, as well as estimating the standard deviations and credible intervals for the combined estimates.\nWe fit initial models to all species with at least 30 detections for density estimation and 10 detections for occupancy estimation. For density estimation, we fit the full model after determining whether there were enough detections based on results from the detection-only model fits. In some cases for both density and occupancy estimation, it was necessary to use a less parsimonious detection structure or simplified model structure to facilitate model convergence. We currently maintain version control of the automated analysis code in the Bird Conservancy repository on www.github.com."
