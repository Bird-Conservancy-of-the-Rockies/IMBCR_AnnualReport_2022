<p>We obtained results for Pinedale Field Office by compiling and analyzing data from one stratum.</p>
<p>Field technicians completed all planned surveys (100%) in 2022. Technicians conducted 105 point counts within the 8 surveyed grid cells between NA NA and NA NA. They detected 46 bird species, including 5 priority species.</p>
<p>Bird Conservancy estimated densities and population sizes for 95 species that were detected in any year during which surveys were conducted, 6 of which are priority species. The data yielded robust density estimates (CV &lt; 50%) for 20 species.</p>
<p>Bird Conservancy estimated the proportion of 1 km² grid cells occupied (Ψ, Psi) throughout Pinedale Field Office for 97 species that were detected in any year during which surveys were conducted, 6 of which are priority species. The data yielded robust occupancy estimates (CV &lt; 50%) for 16 species.</p>
