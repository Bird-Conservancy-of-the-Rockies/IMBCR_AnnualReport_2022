    "text": "2022 Field Season Report\nBird Conservancy of the Rockies (Bird Conservancy), in conjunction with its partners, conducted the 15th consecutive year of landbird monitoring for the Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions (IMBCR) program.\nIMBCR is based on a spatially balanced sampling design which provides inference to avian populations at various scales, from local management units to entire states or Bird Conservation Regions, facilitating conservation at local and national levels. The nested design also provides a consistent and flexible framework for understanding and comparing the status and annual changes of bird populations with local and regional context.\nCollaboration across organizations and spatial scales increases sample sizes and improves the accuracy and precision of population estimates. Analyzing the data collectively allows us to estimate detection probabilities for species that would otherwise have insufficient numbers of detections at local scales.\nFor these reasons, the IMBCR program is well-positioned to address conservation and management needs for a wide range of stakeholders, encouraging an interdisciplinary approach to bird conservation that combines monitoring, research, and management.  \nBird Conservancy of the Rockies\n14500 Lark Bunting Lane\nBrighton, CO 80603\n303-659-4348\nwww.birdconservancy.org\nTech.

    "text": "In 2022, the IMBCR program’s area of inference encompassed four entire states (Colorado, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming) and portions of 11 additional states (Arizona, California, Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, and South Dakota). We surveyed across US Forest Service (USFS) Regions 1, 2, and 4 and in portions of Region 3; all of the Badlands and Prairies Bird Conservation Region (BCR 17), and portions of nine other BCRs: Great Basin (9), Northern Rockies (10), Prairie Potholes (11), Sierra Nevada (15), Southern Rockies/Colorado Plateau (16), Shortgrass Prairie (18), Central Mixed Grass Prairie (19), Sonoran and Mojave Deserts (33), and Sierra Madre Occidental (34).\nObservers conducted 15,066 point counts within 1,340 sampling units between May 1 and July 25, 2022. They detected 194,859 individual birds representing 355 species. This report summarizes the results of the 2022 field season.\n\nTo view interactive maps illustrating survey and detection locations, and tables displaying species counts and population estimates (i.e., density and occupancy), please visit the Rocky Mountain Avian Data Center (RMADC).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions for using the RMADC are included in Appendix A of this report and are available on the RMADC itself (hover over the “Explore the Data” tab for tutorials). Each stratum or combination of strata presented in this report’s Results section contains a web link that leads directly to the RMADC with the appropriate queries already populated. Please note that not every stratum or conceivable combination of strata is summarized in this report. However, all individual strata and all biologically meaningful combinations of strata, or “superstrata”, can be found on the RMADC.\n\n\n\nLong-term, rigorous monitoring provides valuable information on population status, allowing managers and biologists to focus limited resources on species of greatest concern. In the Discussion, we provide a few examples demonstrating the use of IMBCR population trends for tracking the status of designated species of concern and determining where specific populations may require management or conservation efforts."

    "text": "Monitoring is an essential component of wildlife management and conservation science (Marsh & Trenham, 2008; Witmer, 2005). Common goals of population monitoring are to estimate the population status of target species and to detect changes in populations over time (Sauer & Knutson, 2008; Thompson, White, & Gowan, 1998). In addition to providing basic information on species distributions, effective monitoring programs can identify species that are at-risk because of small or declining populations (Dreitz, Lukacs, & Knopf, 2006); provide an understanding of how management actions affect populations (Alexander, Stephens, Geupel, & Will, 2008; Lyons, Runge, Laskowski, & Kendall, 2008); and evaluate population responses to landscape alteration and climate change (Baron et al., 2008; Lindenmayer & Likens, 2009).\nWhile monitoring at local scales remains critical, there is an increasing need to monitor the consequences of environmental change over large spatial and temporal scales and address questions much larger than those that can be answered within individual management units (Dreitz, Stinson, Hahn, Tack, & Lukacs, 2017; Lindenmayer & Likens, 2009). Reconciling disparities between the geographic scale of management actions and the scale of ecological and species-specific responses is a persistent challenge for natural resource management agencies (Ruggiero, Hayward, & Squires, 1994). Population monitoring of eco-regional landscapes provides an important context for evaluating population change at local and regional scales, with the potential to identify causal factors and management actions for species recovery (Manley, Schlesinger, Roth, & Van Horne, 2005; Sauer & Knutson, 2008).\nBefore monitoring can be used by land managers to guide conservation efforts, sound program designs and analytical methods are necessary to produce unbiased population estimates (Sauer & Knutson, 2008). At the most fundamental level, reliable knowledge about the status of avian populations requires accounting for spatial variation and incomplete detection of the target species (Pollock et al., 2002; Rosenstock, Anderson, Giesen, Leukering, & Carter, 2002; Thompson, 2002). Addressing spatial variation entails the use of probabilistic sampling designs, which allows population estimates to be extended over the entire area of interest (Thompson et al., 1998). Accounting for incomplete detection involves the use of appropriate sampling and analytical methods to address the fact that few, if any, species are so conspicuous that they are detected with certainty when present during a survey. Accounting for these two sources of variation ensures that observed trends reflect true population changes rather than artifacts of the sampling and observation processes (Pollock et al., 2002; Thompson, 2002).\nThe apparent large-scale declines of avian populations and the loss, fragmentation and degradation of native habitats highlight the need for extensive and rigorous landbird monitoring programs (Rich et al., 2004; US North American Bird Conservation Initiative Monitoring Subcommittee, 2007). The US North American Bird Conservation Initiative’s (NABCI) “Opportunities for Improving Avian Monitoring” (NABCI Monitoring Subcommittee, 2007) provided goals for avian monitoring programs including:\n\nGoal 1: Fully integrate monitoring into bird management and conservation practices and ensure that monitoring is aligned with management and conservation priorities.\nGoal 2: Coordinate monitoring programs among organizations and integrate them across spatial scales to solve conservation or management problems effectively.\nGoal 3: Increase the value of monitoring information by improving statistical design.\nGoal 4: Maintain bird population monitoring data in modern data management systems. Recognize legal, institutional, proprietary, and other constraints while still providing greater availability of raw data, associated metadata, and summary data for bird monitoring programs.\n\nWith the NABCI Monitoring Subcommittee (2007) guidelines in mind, Bird Conservancy of the Rockies and partners initiated a broad-scale collaborative bird monitoring program in 2008 entitled “Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions” (IMBCR) (Blakesley & Hanni, 2009). See Appendix B: IMBCR Program and Stratification History for a complete history of this program. The monitoring objectives of the IMBCR partnership are to:\n\nProvide robust density, population and occupancy estimates that account for incomplete detection and are comparable at different geographic extents;\nProvide long-term status and trend data for all regularly occurring breeding landbird species throughout the study area;\nProvide a design framework to spatially integrate existing bird monitoring efforts in the region to provide better information on distribution and abundance of breeding landbirds, especially for high priority species;\nProvide basic habitat association data for most bird species to address habitat management issues;\nMaintain a high-quality database that effectively merges records between regional data nodes and is accessible to all of our collaborators as well as to the public over the internet, in the form of raw and summarized data; and\nGenerate decision support tools that help guide conservation efforts and provide a better measure of conservation success.\n\nThe IMBCR design includes Bird Conservation Regions (BCRs) as sampling frames, stratified by land ownership inside each BCR (NABCI Monitoring Subcommittee, 2007). BCRs provide a spatially consistent framework for bird conservation in North America. Each BCR represents a distinct ecological region with similar bird communities, vegetation types, and resource management interests (NABCI, 2000). Population monitoring within BCRs is implemented with a flexible hierarchical framework of nested units, where information on bird populations can be partitioned into smaller units for small-scale conservation planning, or aggregated to support large-scale conservation efforts. By focusing on scales relevant to management and conservation, information obtained from monitoring in BCRs can be integrated into research and management objectives at various scales applicable to managers (Pavlacky et al., 2017; Ruth et al., 2003)."

    "section": "Trend Estimates",
    "text": "Trend Estimates\nWe estimated species population trends for data collected through 2022. Results can be found here. Individual stratum estimates are compiled by state.\nTo find superstratum estimates, select a spreadsheet for any state included in the superstratum. For example, to find estimates for the Badlands and Prairies Bird Conservation Region (BCR 17), select the spreadsheet for Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, North Dakota, or South Dakota. Given the size of each state’s spreadsheet, it will likely be useful to filter estimates by stratum or bird species.\nAlso, we do not include trend estimates for species with zero detections in a given stratum, and use caution when interpreting trends for low-density species at the superstratum (regional) level when there were zero detections in a given year. In these cases, we add a very small number to the estimate (i.e., half the minimum non-zero estimate) in order to take the log of the estimate. This increases uncertainty around the trend estimates.\nExplanation of the columns in the trend estimates spreadsheets are as follows:\nStratum: the abbreviated code for an individual stratum or the name of a superstratum (i.e., contains 2 or more individual strata)\nStratum Name: full name for an individual stratum (note, this column will contain NA for superstrata as the name is contained in the “stratum” column for superstrata)\nSpecies: full name of bird species. Note that we record a few mammals detected on surveys, such as red and Abert’s squirrels and pika\nScientificName: scientific name for each species\nMean: mean trend estimate per year based on all years a stratum was surveyed. A value of 1 indicates the population is stable, <1 indicates the population is declining and >1 is an increasing population\nSD: standard deviation or amount of variation in the data\nCV: coefficient of variation or ratio of the standard deviation to the mean (lower is better!)\nLCI 95: lower 95% credible interval; the true estimate lies within the lower and upper 95% credible intervals with 95% probability\nUCI 95: upper 95% credible interval; the true estimate lies within the lower and upper 95% credible intervals with 95% probability\nLCI 90: same interpretation as 95% LCI but with 90% probability\nUCI 90: same interpretation as 95% UCI but with 90% probability\nMedian: value that represents the midpoint of the distribution. We recommend reporting the median rather than the mean because some credible intervals have long tails so the means can be quite a bit higher than the medians, especially for estimates near zero. Medians are also more representative of the distributions\nf: the probability the trend is in the direction of the mean. This is our confidence in the direction of the trend (not necessarily the magnitude). As ‘f’ approaches 1, our confidence increases (e.g., if the trend estimate is 1.16 and ‘f’ is 0.88, then we are 88% sure the population is increasing)\nN.Detect: the number of detections used to estimate trend for each species-stratum combination\nN.Strata.Det: the number of strata with a detection used to estimate regional (superstrata) trends. This column will contain an “NA” for individual strata.\nN.Strata: the number of strata contained in a superstratum (minimum number of strata within a superstratum is 2). This column will contain an “NA” for individual strata."

    "section": "Number of Species with Estimates",
    "text": "Number of Species with Estimates\nThe way we present density and occupancy estimates in the final report has changed from years prior to 2018. In the past, if a species had been detected in a stratum in a previous year, but was not detected in the current year, we did not provide density or occupancy estimates for that species in that stratum. We now include estimates for these species. In these cases, the estimate for a given year is zero or very close to zero. We consider these to be legitimate estimates of zero occupancy or density because the species occurs in the area of interest, but was not detected in a particular year.\nThis change means that the number of species with density or occupancy estimates for a given stratum or superstratum in a given year is not comparable to the number of species with estimates for that stratum or superstratum and year in reports prior to 2018. The number of species in the current report will include species with zero, or near zero estimates, if that species has been detected in previous years, whereas reports before 2018 will not. Therefore, there may be more species with estimates for a given stratum in a final report for 2018 and later."

Some overlay projects include:\n\nMonitored birds in the Atlantic Rim Natural Gas area (south-central Wyoming) to determine energy development impacts on birds, and set management triggers to determine when a threshold is met for sagebrush songbird occupancy in the project area compared to surrounding BLM lands.\n\n\nExamined community-level effects and bird species relationships with restoration treatments under the USFS’s Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program implemented across the Front Range in Colorado.\n\n\nCompared population estimates on private ranches in the Great Plains to estimates in the surrounding region to see if ranches participating in the Audubon Conservation Ranching program provide breeding habitat for grassland birds."

    "text": "18.2 Adaptive Management\nMonitoring is a key part of adaptive management, providing the means for assessing the impacts of management changes and improving system understanding (Lyons et al., 2008; Nichols & Williams, 2006). The IMBCR program accommodates the principles of adaptive monitoring (Lindenmayer & Likens, 2009) because it:\n\naddresses well-defined and tractable questions\n\nis underpinned by rigorous science\nis based on a conceptual model of how bird populations function and\n\nis relevant to the management of natural resources (Pavlacky et al., 2017).\n\nUnder the adaptive monitoring framework, the objectives, sampling design, data collection, analysis, and interpretation are iterative, allowing the program to evolve and develop in response to new information or new management questions. The IMBCR program allows for different stratification schemes across states and regions and the re-stratification of local management units to better address partner management objectives or new questions. The flexible hierarchical design also accommodates annual fluctuation of sampling intensity without compromising regional population estimates. In addition, overlay projects can address specific management questions or hypotheses without affecting the integrity of the overall IMBCR framework."
