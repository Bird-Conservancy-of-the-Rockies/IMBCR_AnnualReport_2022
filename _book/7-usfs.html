<p>We obtained results for Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest by compiling and jointly analyzing data from five strata.</p>
<p>Field technicians completed 19 of 21 planned surveys (90%) in 2022. Technicians conducted 173 point counts within the 21 surveyed grid cells between May 22 and July 6. They detected 99 bird species, including 3 priority species.</p>
<p>Bird Conservancy estimated densities and population sizes for 128 species that were detected in any year during which surveys were conducted, 5 of which are priority species. The data yielded robust density estimates (CV &lt; 50%) for 44 species.</p>
<p>Bird Conservancy estimated the proportion of 1 km² grid cells occupied (Ψ, Psi) throughout Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest for 128 species that were detected in any year during which surveys were conducted, 6 of which are priority species. The data yielded robust occupancy estimates (CV &lt; 50%) for 59 species.</p>
